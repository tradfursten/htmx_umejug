# HTMX application for UmeJUG

This repository contains the example application used in the talk I gave at
UmeJUG.


The order view is the only one that currently uses HTMX and I have left the other views to be worked on as an excercise.

Example of things you could implement:

- Make all the creation of exchange days and sellers use htmx
-  Make the show hide sellers/orders htmxified
- Enable inline editing on the order view
- Enable inline editing of the sellers in the exchange day view
- Create a long polling mechanism or some thing similar in the seller view to update the view when an order is created or updated
